        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone! Just call me Ayu. I am a Cohort of Bangkit Academy 2023, specialized in Cloud Computing Learning Path.
           I am a student of Computer Science Faculty in Brawijaya University, majoring in Information Systems. Currently, I am staying
           in Jakarta with my parents due to the self-placed learning (I don't need to go to the campus). And thanks for that, Bangkit ^_^
